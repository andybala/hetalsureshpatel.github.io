I am a .NET developer who has worked cross fat clients, web & mobile all using .NET stack. In recent years I have embraced the software craftmenship manifesto.

This has lead me to try out new platforms and languages. Which has definitely influence me in starting blogging.

Currently working at Marks & Spencer's. Previously had worked in a startup [Sanona](http://www.sanona.com), pay per view Bollywood streaming. 

Being geek I enjoy all things geeky.
