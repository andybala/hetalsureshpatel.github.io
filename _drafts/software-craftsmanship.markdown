Why am I writing this post
    My Current experience at teaching. Got me thinking how did I learn to be a better developer.

The problem with young developers today
    Looking to solve the problem quickly.
    Just Google it or Stack it.
    Everything can be found on the internet.
    TDD BDD

How did people learn before.
    - Not sure how they learned before but can explain how I was taught.

Bring this back.
    Helps to filter bullshit on the internet.
    Helps you to learn new things.
    essence of a developer is to ask questions to find a deeper meaning.
