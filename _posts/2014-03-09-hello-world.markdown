As in true form, whenever doing anything for the first time in software development. You create a hello world application. Who am I to go against tradition.

__[Zan a friend of mine][zmarkan]__ introduced me to something called [Jekyll][jekyll] which, is a static website builder. __I know what your thinking, a static site in this day and age__. It took me while to get my head around it too. From knowing nothing to getting a blog site up and running took me a Sunday afternoon.

This was all possible because GitHub now provide users with free hosting, they call it [GitHub Pages][github-pages]. Once you follow the instructions from the [Jekyll][jekyll-doc] site. It becomes trivial if don't mind getting your hands dirty with coding. Saying that I spent most of my time googling as there is a lot of help out there, especially when it came to picking my theme.

If you are a windows user, like I am. You get the distinct feeling that Jekyll style does take getting used too. I would say persevere because it is with it. Viewed in a different way, you are exposing your self to a different development environment. Working on real world problem that beats any text book examples.
